<h2> 
What You Need To Begin Postgres-XC
</h2> 
 
<h3> 
Starting with Minimum Hardware
</h3> 
 
<p> 
You can install the Postgres-XC on a single server, if you want to just try it out and 
understand how to configure and execute it.
You may also install and use different virtual machines for different Postgres-XC component
or set of its components.
</p> 
<p> 
Although you can install Postgres-XC cluster in single Linux operating system,
we advise you to install on multiple Linux virtual machines 
using Virtual Box or VMWare.
The number of virtual machines depends on the Postgres-XC configuration.
Please take a look at configuration section in this page.
</p> 
<p> 
We advise you to use 64bit architecture Intel machines with at least 4GB of 
memory even in this case.
</p> 
<p> 
You may be able to choose any popular Linux operating system for 
Intel 64bit architecture.
The developemnt team uses CentOS 5.4 for testing and evaluation.
</p> 
<p> 
A minimum hardware configuration will be useful to test Postgres-XC features.
Of course, if you'd like to better experience how Postgres-XC scales, we advise you to use multiple servers for your cluster.
</p> 
 
<h3> 
Multi-node Cluster
</h3> 
 
<p> 
You can also configure Postgres-XC on several servers.
For example, the Postgres-XC development team is using eleven servers in total to
run Postgres-XC and another four servers to generate a workload for performance testing.
If possible, we advise to have at least three servers and one additional 
(slow and inexpensive) server for Postgres-XC, 
and another (one or more) server to run your application.
</p> 
 
<h3> 
Operating Systems
</h3> 
 
<p> 
Postgres-XC currently runs on the Linux Operating Systems running on 64-bit Intel(R)
processors.
</p> 
<p> 
The development team tested this with Cent-OS 5.3 and 5.4.
</p> 
 
<h2> 
Before You Start
</h2> 
 
<p> 
We advise to read the documentation carefully before you start.
Most of the installation steps are very similar to PostgreSQL but you should take
extra care in configuring the Postgres-XC cluster.
</p> 
<p> 
The Installation Manual will be helpful to build and deploy binaries to 
the cluster.
</p> 
<p> 
The Tutorial Manual is a guide to install DBT-1 benchmark as a model application.
</p> 
<p> 
The Arcitecture document will give you detailed background as to how Postgres-XC works
and how you can configure your Postgres-XC cluster.
