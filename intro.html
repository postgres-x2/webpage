<h2> 
Welcome to Postgres-XC
</h2> 
<p> 
Welcome to Postgres-XC, the only known PostgreSQL cluster solution 
which provides for both read and write scalability.
</p> 
<p> 
This website includes useful information to understand, download, build, deploy and use Postgres-XC.
</p> 
<p> 
If you are familiar with the project outline, please visit individual pages
as desired.
If not, we advise you to first visit each page of this site to obtain
a proper understanding of Postgres-XC and how it can help you.
</p> 
<p> 
All of the Postgres-XC team members are looking forward to continuing to improve Postgres-XC and working with you to help solve  your database scalability problems.
</p> 
<p> 
Enjoy.

<!-- === Postgres-XC outline === --> 
<h2> 
What Is Postgres-XC?
</h2> 
<p> 
Postgres-XC is an open source project to provide a write-scalable, 
synchronous multi-master,
transparent PostgreSQL cluster solution. 
It is a collection if tightly coupled database components 
which can be installed in more than one hardware or virtual machines.
</p> 
<p> 
Write-scalable means Postgres-XC can be configured 
with as many database servers as you want and handle many more writes 
(updating SQL statements) compared to what a single database server can not do. 
</p> 
<p> 
Multi-master means you can have more than one database server
that clients connect to which provide a single, consistent cluster-wide view of the database.
</p> 
<p> 
Synchronous means any database update from any database server is 
immediately visible to any other transactions running on different masters.
</p> 
<p> 
Transparent means you (and your applications) do not have to worry about how your data is stored 
in more than one database servers internally.
</p> 
<p> 
You can configure Postgres-XC to run on multiple servers. 
Your data is stored in a distributed way, that is, 
partitioned or replicated, as chosen by you for each table.
When you issue queries, Postgres-XC determines 
where the target data is stored and issues corresponding queries 
to servers containing the target data.
